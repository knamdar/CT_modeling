# Modeling CT

For a proper operation of the protection system during electromagnetic transients, proper representation and modeling of the current transformer (CT) and the potential transformer (PT) is necessary. The CT model should accurately represent the transient characteristics of the CT in practical use. In this paper, Lucas model of a CT is discussed, the model parameters of a practical CT is used to study the CT saturation characteristics for a fault with line reclosure conditions and for CT secondary burdens
